const operationCode: number = 42
const operationAllowed: boolean = true
const agent: object = {famous:{name: "Kreog", code: 42}, newbie:{name: "Mate", code: 42}, noname:{code: 42}}

operationCode` of `42` (that's our secret code, don't talk about it to the anyone)
Then we will need an `operationAllowed` to `true`
After that, we need the `operationName` to be `KSW`
And finaly, we need a list of `agents`. Here the list:
  * The famous agent with the `name` `Kreog` and `code` `42`.
  * A newbie with the `name` `Mate` and `code` `21`.
  * An agent without `name` but with the `code` `0.07`
  *
